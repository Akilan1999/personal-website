      <description>How is this website build and the idea behind ? This websites runs using HUGO which static website engine. HUGO makes it really easy to add and remove content. I used a very simple and minimal template called hermit. As I learned from my friend Humaid it is more important to focus on content rather than some fancy JS animations.</description>
