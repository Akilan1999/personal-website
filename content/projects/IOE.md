The excess carbon emissions has been dramatically rising. The changes are visible in the most sensitive places such as polar ice caps. It starts with huge demands with electricity and fuel cars. We want to be a part of the solution rather than the part of our problem. Our platform creates the opportunity where those who want can sell electricity to anyone in the grid. We currently only work on prototypes and we are striving on making the application production ready.

## Motivation 
Our  inspiration  comes  from  the  design  of  a  rechargeable battery  (i.e.power  banks).  We  introduce  a  concept  called transactional  battery.Current  travelling through households will reduce battery duration and also cause more power loss. This  can  be  fixed  by  just  forwarding  and  receiving  power all from  just  one  transactional battery  per  locality.  The  number of nodes a transactionalbatterycan host depends based on the battery  type  used.  To eliminatepower  loss  a  transactional battery can be hooked up with solar panels or most prominent renewable power source available in thatarea. To ensure that we can transfer energy from one micro grid to another we can scale it up the same way, i.e.,transactional battery connected to another transactional battery of a higher level.Every micro grid will have a unique IDlike a domain name that links to the server  IPV6  address  and  server  which  controls  getting  or giving  power  from  the  battery.  The  communication  will  be standard TCP/IP to improve software development speed and adding more features. An open source software can be run by  a  non-profit  organization  like  ICANN  that  could  allow buying and selling of electricity.
