## How is this website build and the idea behind ?

This websites runs using HUGO which static website engine. HUGO makes it
really easy to add and remove content. I used a very simple and minimal template
called [hermit](https://themes.gohugo.io/hermit/). As I learned from my friend [Humaid](https://humaidq.ae) it is more important to focus on content rather than some
fancy JS animations.
